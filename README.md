### ðŸš€ My Projects

Here are some projects I'm proud of.

* **AI Resume Chatbot** `(Python, Gradio, OpenAI, Gemini, Pydantic)`
  * Developed an interactive AI chatbot that acts as my "digital twin," allowing recruiters to ask questions about my skills and experience in a conversational way.
  * Engineered a self-correction mechanism using a Gemini-powered evaluation agent to improve answer accuracy.
  * Integrated intelligent tool-use for logging unanswered questions and capturing recruiter interest with real-time notifications.

* **RAG Similarity Search** `(Python, Docker, OpenAI, PostgreSQL/pg-vector)`
  * Architected a containerized and scalable backend for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution.
  * Implemented high-performance vector search using `pgvector` and OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model with ANN indexing to accelerate query speeds.

* **Multi-Agent Workflows with OpenAI SDK** `(Python, OpenAI SDK, Pydantic)`
  * Built a demonstration of advanced, multi-agent workflows showcasing agent tooling, handoffs, and input guardrails.
  * Designed a sequential workflow where a manager agent hands off tasks to specialized agents for granular tasks like email subject line generation and HTML conversion.

* **YouTube Channel Engagement Analysis** `(Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)`
  * Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on large, multi-regional datasets to identify drivers of video popularity.
