I am a Software Engineer with a strong background in developing scalable and secure software solutions, specializing in Python and Django. My passion lies in architecting systems that not only solve complex problems but also drive significant business outcomes, such as reducing costs and automating manual processes. I thrive on building robust applications, from AI-powered conversational engines to PCI-compliant payment gateways, that enable businesses to innovate and grow.  

  • Payment Gateway Engineering:   
Engineered a secure, PCI-compliant payment gateway in Django that tokenized all cardholder data on the client-side, which reduced compliance scope and audit costs by over 80%.  
  • Subscription Engine Development:   
Developed a self-managed subscription engine in Django, which fully automated the billing lifecycle and eliminated 100% of manual billing errors, launching a new recurring revenue model.  
  • CMS Architecture:   
Led the development of a scalable Content Management System (CMS) using Python and Django, which decreased website deployment time by 40%.  
  • Automated Invoice System:   
Designed an automated invoice gathering system using Python and Selenium that increased processing speed by 80% and reduced manual workload by approximately 50 hours per month.  
  • AI Engine Optimization:   
Improved AI response selection accuracy by 30% by implementing a Monte Carlo Simulation to evaluate and rank AI-generated responses.
